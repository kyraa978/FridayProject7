Friday Project 7 Overview

Friday Project 1 Notes:
The program prompts the user for adjectives, objects, and a place. These inputs are stored in variables and then inserted into a pre-written story using f-strings. The final story is printed to the console, combining user-provided words with the story template.


Friday Project 2 Notes:
The code generates random numbers for a Powerball lottery ticket. It imports the random module, generates numbers for five white balls and one red PowerBall, and then prints the generated numbers in a user-friendly format.


Friday Project 3 Notes:
The program greets the user and asks if they want to play a number guessing game. If the user agrees, a random number is generated. The user then makes guesses until they guess the correct number, receiving feedback on each attempt.


Friday Project 4 Notes:
The code defines a dictionary of trivia questions and answers. It then iterates through the dictionary, presents each question to the user, and checks their answer against the correct answer, providing feedback.

Friday Project 5:
The code defines functions to color text using ANSI escape sequences. It then creates a loop to allow the user to repeatedly input text and choose a color to apply to it. The chosen color function is used to format and print the colored text.

Friday Project 6 Notes:
The code defines a BankAccount class with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance. The main program creates an account instance and allows the user to interact with it by depositing, withdrawing, or checking the balance.
